<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

In this project, I learned how to do data modeling with PostgreSQL and how build an ETL pipeline using Python.

I applied what I've learned on data modeling using these tools to build a table schema, and to write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables.

### Project Description

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

### Tools Used

* Python
* PostgreSQL
* Jupyter notebooks

### Datasets
#### Song Dataset

This first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.

Sample:
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

#### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

Sample:
```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```



## Data Modeling

### ERD

In this case I knew before-hand that the data types are structured (JSONs) and the amount of data we need to analyze is not big enough to require big data related solutions.

For that reason I used the Star Schema for data modeling in this ETL pipeline, there is one fact table containing all the metrics associated to each event songplays, and four dimensions tables, containing complementary informations about songs, artists, users and time, each with a primary key that is being referenced from the fact table. This structure will allow the analysts to do joins and aggregations of the data efficiently.


You can see an Entity Eelationship Diagram (ERD) of the built data model below:

## Project structure

Files:

|  File / Folder   |                         Description                          |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|       data       | Folder at the root of the project, where all song and log data resides |
|      images      |  Folder at the root of the project, where ERD image is stored  |
|  sql_queries.py  |      Contains the SQL queries used for data modeling and ETL      |
| create_tables.py |         Drops and creates all tables. This will reset the tables when executed |
|    test.ipynb    | Some codes to test and test the proper functioning and assure the datai ntegrity |
|    etl.ipynb     | Step by step to process one file from song_data and log_data and load the data into the tables |
|      etl.py      | Processes all files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the tables |
|      README      |                         Readme file                          |



## How to Run

Clone the repository into a local machine using

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BinariesGoalls/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree
```

### Prerequisites

These are the tools necessaries to run the program.

* Python
* PostgreSQL
* psycopg2, glob and pandas python libraries

### Steps

Follow the steps to extract and load the data into the data model.

1. Navigate to `Project 1 Data Modeling with PostgreSQL` folder

2. Run `create_tables.py` to create/reset the tables by

   ```python
   python create_tables.py
   ```

3. Run ETL process and load data into database by 

   ```python
   python etl.py
   ```

4. Use `test.ipynb` to check whether the data has been loaded into database
