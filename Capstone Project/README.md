<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Project Summary

Olist is a Brazilian startup with headquarter in Curitiba. Its business model is of the e-commerce type, with the main objective of helping people who sell a product to find buyers in all Brazilian e-commerce.

Olist has been growing a lot in recent years, due to the increase in new users and also the increase in transactions on its platform. And a company's growing pains are inevitable, especially with data.

The whole system extends its capacity, both in terms of processing and in terms of data storage, and consequently the query time to databases increases, impacting the speed of analysis and the time to update metrics in dashboards.

The objective of this project was to create an ETL pipeline on the olist datasets to create a analytic Data Warehouse on Amazon Redshift. A use case for this analytic database is to find answers for some questions such as "Has the amount of sales has increased over time?", "Which product categories are top sellers?", "What is the total turnover?", et cetera.

With this in mind, the project will follow these steps:

* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
* Step 3: Define the Data Model
* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up

### Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
#### Scope

In this project, we will aggregate the total of eight datasets that represents each one of the tables from the Olist e-commerce OLTP database, with the objective to model this source of data into “Fact” and “Dimension” tables for the analytics team.

The final solution proposed is a pipeline built upon Python for ingesting data from Amazon S3 into a Redshift Data Warehouse, running transformations on Redshift and saving them into a proposed Star Schema model.

#### Describe and Gather Data

**Data Source** <br>

Brazilian E-Commerce Public Datasets by Olist <br>

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

**Content** <br>

Olist is the largest department store on marketplaces. It has a catalog with over 950,000 products, hundreds of thousands of orders and a network of over 9,000 partner retailers spread across all regions of Brazil. 

All the files use the CSV format.

**Model** <br>

The data sources are the company's e-commerce OLTP system tables, you can check the ERD of the system in the figure below.

![database](./images/Project%204%20tables%20ERD.png)

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

#### Log Dataset

The second dataset is generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim). These log files in JSON format simulate activity logs from a music streaming application based on specified configurations. The dataset is hosted at S3 bucket `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`.

Sample :

```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```

## Data Modeling

### ERD

In this case I knew before-hand that the data types are structured (JSONs) and the amount of data we need to analyze is not big enough to require big data related solutions.

For that reason I used the Star Schema for data modeling in this ETL pipeline, there is two stging_tbles containing all the files information, one fact table containing all the metrics associated to each event songplays, and four dimensions tables, containing complementary informations about songs, artists, users and time, each with a primary key that is being referenced from the fact table.

The data stored on S3 buckets is staged and then inserted to fact and dimensional tables on Redshift. The whole process in orchestrated using Airflow which is set to execute periodically once every hour.

You can see an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the built data model below:

## Apache Airflow Orchestration 

### DAG Structure

The DAG parameters are set according to the following :

- The DAG does not have dependencies on past runs
- DAG has schedule interval set to hourly
- On failure, the task are retried 3 times
- Retries happen every 5 minutes
- Catchup is turned off
- Email are not sent on retry

The DAG dependency graph is given below.

![dag](./images/DAG.png)

### Operators

Operators create necessary tables, stage the data, transform the data, and run checks on data quality. Connections and Hooks are configured using Airflow's built-in functionalities. All of the operators and task run SQL statements against the Redshift database. 

#### Stage Operator
The stage operator loads any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters specify where in S3, the file is loaded and what is the target table.

- **Task to stage JSON data is included in the DAG and uses the RedshiftStage operator**: There is a task that to stages data from S3 to Redshift (Runs a Redshift copy statement).

- **Task uses params**: Instead of running a static SQL statement to stage the data, the task uses parameters to generate the copy statement dynamically. It also contains a templated field that allows it to load timestamped files from S3 based on the execution time and run backfills.

- **Logging used**: The operator contains logging in different steps of the execution.

- **The database connection is created by using a hook and a connection**: The SQL statements are executed by using a Airflow hook.

#### Fact and Dimension Operators
The dimension and fact operators make use of the SQL helper class to run data transformations. Operators take as input the SQL statement from the helper class and target the database on which to run the query against. A target table is also defined that contains the results of the transformation.

Dimension loads are done with the truncate-insert pattern where the target table is emptied before the load. There is a parameter that allows switching between insert modes when loading dimensions. Fact tables are massive so they only allow append type functionality.

- **Set of tasks using the dimension load operator is in the DAG**: Dimensions are loaded with on the LoadDimension operator.

- **A task using the fact load operator is in the DAG**: Facts are loaded with on the LoadFact operator.

- **Both operators use params**: Instead of running a static SQL statement to stage the data, the task uses parameters to generate the copy statement dynamically.

- **The dimension task contains a param to allow switch between append and insert-delete functionality**: The DAG allows to switch between append-only and delete-load functionality.

#### Data Quality Operator
The data quality operator is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result are checked and if there is no match, the operator raises an exception and the task is retried and fails eventually.

For example one test could be a SQL statement that checks if certain column contains NULL values by counting all the rows that have NULL in the column. We do not want to have any NULLs so expected result would be 0 and the test would compare the SQL statement's outcome to the expected result.

- **A task using the data quality operator is in the DAG and at least one data quality check is done**: Data quality check is done with correct operator.

- **The operator raises an error if the check fails**: The DAG either fails or retries n times.

- **The operator is parametrized**: Operator uses params to get the tests and the results, tests are not hard coded to the operator.


### Airflow UI views of DAG and plugins

The DAG follows the data flow provided in the instructions, all the tasks have a dependency and DAG begins with a start_execution task and ends with a end_execution task.
