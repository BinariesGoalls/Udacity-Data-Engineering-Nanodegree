<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Nanodegree

You can check more details about the nanodegree program on this link: <a href=https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027><strong>Data Engineering Nanodegree</strong></a>

## **Program Details**

During this program, I will learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets. At the end of the program, I’ll combine my new skills by completing a capstone project.

#### **Course 1 – Data Modeling**

In this course, I’ll learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data
consumers. I’ll understand the differences between different data models, and how to choose the
appropriate data model for a given situation. I’ll also build fluency in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

You can find my demos and exercices related to this course [here](./Demos%20and%20Exercises/Data%20Modeling).

The first project can be found here [Project 1: Data Modeling with PostgreSQL](./Project%201%20Data%20Modeling%20With%20PostgreSQL). 

The second project can be found here [Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](./Project%202%20Data%20Modeling%20With%20Apache%20Cassandra). 

#### **Course 2 – Cloud Data Warehouses**

In this course, I’ll learn to create cloud-based data warehouses. I’ll sharpen my data warehousing skills, deepen my 
understanding of data infrastructure, and be introduced to data engineering on the cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

You can find my demos and exercices related to this course [here](./Demos%20and%20Exercises/Cloud%20Data%20Warehouses).

This course project can be found here [Project 3: Data Warehouse](./Project%203%20Data%20Warehouse). 

#### **Course 3 – Spark and Data Lakes**

In this course, i'll learn about the big data ecosystem and how to use Spark to work with
massive datasets. I'll also learn about how to store big data in a data lake and query it with Spark.

You can find my demos and exercices related to this course [here](./Demos%20and%20Exercises/Spark%20and%20Data%20Lakes).

This course project can be found here [Project 4: Data Lake](./Project%204%20Data%20Lake). 

#### **Course 4 – Automate Data Pipelines**

In this course, I’ll learn how to schedule, automate, and monitor data pipelines using Apache Airflow. I’ll learn to run data quality checks, track data lineage, and work with data pipelines in production.

You can find my demos and exercices related to this course [here](./).

This course project can be found here [Project 5: Data Pipelines with Airflow](./Project%205%20Data%20Pipelines%20with%20Apache%20Airflow). 

#### **Capstone Project**

In this module I have combined my new skills by completing a capstone project.

The project can be found here [Capstone Project: ETL Pipeline for a Brazillian E-Commerce](./Capstone%20Project).
